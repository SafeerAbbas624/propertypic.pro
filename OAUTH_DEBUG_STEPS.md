# OAuth Debug - Working Server, Need Google Console Fix

## Current Status ‚úÖ
- **Server OAuth callback is working correctly** 
- **Redirect URI is properly configured: `http://localhost:5000/auth/google/callback`**
- **OAuth scope is correct: `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive`**

## The Problem üîç
Google is still showing "Access to localhost was denied" because the Google Cloud Console configuration needs time to propagate OR the test user wasn't added correctly.

## Next Steps (In Order):

### 1. Double-Check Test User Configuration
Go to: https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials/consent
- Verify `stads98@gmail.com` is listed under "Test users"
- Make sure you're in the correct project 
- Click "SAVE" again if needed

### 2. Verify OAuth Client Redirect URIs
Go to: https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials
- Click on your OAuth 2.0 Client ID
- Confirm these URIs are listed:
  - ‚úÖ `http://localhost:5000/auth/google/callback`
  - ‚úÖ `https://workspace-stads98.replit.app/auth/google/callback`
- Click "SAVE" again

### 3. Wait for Propagation (Important!)
- Google Cloud changes can take 5-15 minutes to propagate
- Try waiting 10 minutes before testing again

### 4. Alternative: Try OAuth with Different Project
If still not working, you may need to create a new OAuth client with:
- Project name: "ProxyPics" or "Property Inspection"
- Authorized redirect URIs: Both localhost and Replit URLs
- Test users: `stads98@gmail.com`

## Expected Behavior After Fix:
1. Click "Connect Now"
2. Google OAuth consent screen appears
3. Shows: "ProxyPics wants access to your Google Account"
4. You click "Allow"
5. **Redirect back to ProxyPics homepage with success message**
6. Green "Google Drive Connected" status appears

## Current Client ID Being Used:
`691557692182-7mp70e0m4njagco6sfkh3jpu3qlq4i9n.apps.googleusercontent.com`

Make sure this Client ID matches the one you're configuring in Google Cloud Console.
