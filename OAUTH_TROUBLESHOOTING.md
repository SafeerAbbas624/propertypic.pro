# OAuth 403 Troubleshooting - After 15+ Minutes

## Current Status
- ✅ Server OAuth configuration is correct
- ✅ OAuth URL generation working properly  
- ✅ Callback route accessible
- ❌ Still getting "Access to localhost was denied" after 15+ minutes

## Root Cause Analysis

The persistent 403 error after waiting indicates one of these issues:

### 1. **Wrong Project in Google Cloud Console**
- You may be configuring a different Google Cloud project than the one your OAuth Client ID belongs to
- **Client ID**: `691557692182-7mp70e0m4njagco6sfkh3jpu3qlq4i9n.apps.googleusercontent.com`
- Make sure you're in the correct project when adding redirect URIs

### 2. **Client ID Mismatch**
- The OAuth client in Google Console might have a different Client ID
- Verify the Client ID in your OAuth credentials matches exactly

### 3. **Redirect URI Format Issue**
- Google is very strict about redirect URI format
- Must be exactly: `http://localhost:5000/auth/google/callback`
- No trailing slash, no extra parameters

## Solutions to Try

### Option A: Verify Current OAuth Client
1. Go to: https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials
2. Find client with ID: `691557692182-7mp70e0m4njagco6sfkh3jpu3qlq4i9n`
3. If not found, you're in the wrong project
4. If found, check redirect URIs match exactly

### Option B: Create New OAuth Client
If the client doesn't exist or has issues:
1. Go to: https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials
2. Click "Create Credentials" → "OAuth 2.0 Client ID"
3. Application type: "Web application"
4. Name: "ProxyPics Local Development"
5. Authorized redirect URIs: `http://localhost:5000/auth/google/callback`
6. Copy the new Client ID and update GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID secret

### Option C: Use Replit Domain Instead
Try using the Replit domain for OAuth:
1. Update redirect URI to: `https://workspace-stads98.replit.app/auth/google/callback`
2. Test OAuth from the deployed Replit app instead of localhost

## Quick Test Commands
```bash
# Check if your client exists in Google Console
curl -s "https://oauth2.googleapis.com/tokeninfo?client_id=691557692182-7mp70e0m4njagco6sfkh3jpu3qlq4i9n.apps.googleusercontent.com"

# Check current OAuth URL generation
curl -s "http://localhost:5000/auth/verify-config"
```

## Expected Fix
After finding and fixing the Google Console configuration, OAuth should work immediately - no additional waiting required.
